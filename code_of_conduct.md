---

The Integrated Record of Ancient Life (IRAL) project is dedicated to providing a welcoming, open, and supportive environment for all staff, students and visitors, regardless of experience level, background, or identity. 

To maintain this welcoming, open, and supportive environment, we agree to abide by this Code of Conduct and accept the procedures by which any Code of Conduct incidents are resolved. The Code of Conduct applies to all spaces managed by or affiliated with the IRAL project, including, but not limited to, research/teaching meetings, social events on campus, and online/virtual forums such as emails and social media platforms.

Group members and visitors are expected to behave in a courteous, collegial and respectful fashion, and must show respect for the intellectual and private property of others. Disrespectful behaviour or behaviour that excludes, intimidates, or causes discomfort to others will not be tolerated. 

Discrimination or harassment of any kind will not be tolerated, including, but not limited to, discrimination or harassment based gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, citizenship, nationality, ethnic or social origin, religion or belief, age, education, socio-economic status, and experience level. 

*Courteous, collegial and respectful behaviour:*
- Using welcoming and inclusive language 
- Being respectful of different viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing courtesy and respect towards others

*Unacceptable behaviour:*
- Sustained disruption of talks, events or communications
- Harassment in any form, including sexual harassment, denigrating jokes, stereotyping, or a recurring pattern of microinvalidations, microassaults, microaggressions, and microinsults
- Written or verbal comments which have the effect of excluding people on the basis of membership of any specific group
- Causing someone to fear for their safety, such as through stalking or intimidation
- The display of sexual or violent images
- Nonconsensual or unwelcome physical contact or sexual attention
- Continuing to initiate interaction with someone after being asked to stop

### Reporting unacceptable behaviour:

If you are the subject of unacceptable behaviour or have witnessed any behaviour that violates the Code of Conduct, we ask that you report it. This can be done by (1) speaking in confidence to either (or both) of the project coordinators, (2) by contacting the PaleoSynthesis porject manager, Barbara Seuß. 

All reports will be kept in the strictest confidence. In the case that a project coordinator is involved in a report, the individual will be asked to excuse themselves from ongoing conversations. Once a report is received, the project coordinators will review the incident and determine the appropriate course of action, which may include, but is not limited to:
- A mandatory conversation with the individual to identify to them their unacceptable behaviour
- Removal of the individual from the project
- Filing a report with the individual’s home institution
